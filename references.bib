  abstract = {Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key component of the membrane proximal signaling layer in focal adhesion complexes, regulating important cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and survival. In the cytosol, FAK adopts an autoinhibited state but is activated upon recruitment into focal adhesions, yet how this occurs or what induces structural changes is unknown. Here, we employ cryo-electron microscopy to reveal how FAK associates with lipid membranes and how membrane interactions unlock FAK autoinhibition to promote activation. Intriguingly, initial binding of FAK to the membrane causes steric clashes that release the kinase domain from autoinhibition, allowing it to undergo a large conformational change and interact itself with the membrane in an orientation that places the active site toward the membrane. In this conformation, the autophosphorylation site is exposed and multiple interfaces align to promote FAK oligomerization on the membrane. We show that interfaces responsible for initial dimerization and membrane attachment are essential for FAK autophosphorylation and resulting cellular activity including cancer cell invasion, while stable FAK oligomerization appears to be needed for optimal cancer cell proliferation in an anchorage-independent manner. Together, our data provide structural details of a key membrane bound state of FAK that is primed for efficient autophosphorylation and activation, hence revealing the critical event in integrin mediated FAK activation and signaling at focal adhesions.},

Cells modulate the partitioning of talin between the plasma membrane and the cytosol to control cell adhesion. Here, we combine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) with subcellular fractionation to characterize two distinct THD-rod domain interactions that control the interaction of talin with the actin cytoskeleton or its localization to the plasma membrane. An interaction between a discrete vinculin-binding region of the rod (VBS1/2a; Tln1(482\textendash 787)), and the THD restrains talin from interacting with the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we show that vinculin binding to VBS1/2a results in talin recruitment to the plasma membrane.

  abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

  abstract = {Dok7 is a peripheral membrane protein that is associated with the MuSK receptor tyrosine kinase. Formation of the Dok7/MuSK/membrane complex is required for the activation of MuSK. This is a key step in the complex exchange of signals between neuron and muscle, which lead to neuromuscular junction formation, dysfunction of which is associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes. The Dok7 structure consists of a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain and a Phosphotyrosine Binding (PTB) domain. The mechanism of the Dok7 association with the membrane remains largely unknown. Using multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations we have explored the formation of the Dok7 PH/membrane complex. Our simulations indicate that the PH domain of Dok7 associates with membranes containing phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) via interactions of the {$\beta$}1/{$\beta$}2, {$\beta$}3/{$\beta$}4, and {$\beta$}5/{$\beta$}6 loops, which together form a positively charged surface on the PH domain and interact with the negatively charged headgroups of PIP molecules. The initial encounter of the Dok7 PH domain is followed by formation of additional interactions with the lipid bilayer, and especially with PIP molecules, which stabilizes the Dok7 PH/membrane complex. We have quantified the binding of the PH domain to the model bilayers by calculating a density landscape for protein/membrane interactions. Detailed analysis of the PH/PIP interactions reveal both a canonical and an atypical site to be occupied by the anionic lipid. PH domain binding leads to local clustering of PIP molecules in the bilayer. Association of the Dok7 PH domain with PIP lipids is therefore seen as a key step in localization of Dok7 to the membrane and formation of a complex with MuSK.},

The cytoplasmic protein, talin, binds to {$\beta$} integrin cytoplasmic tails and actin filaments, hence forming an integrin-cytoskeletal linkage. We used recombinant structural mimics of {$\beta$}\textsubscript{1}A, {$\beta$}\textsubscript{1}D and {$\beta$}\textsubscript{3}integrin cytoplasmic tails to characterize integrin-binding sites within talin. Here we report that an integrin-binding site is localized within the N-terminal talin head domain. The binding of the talin head domain to integrin {$\beta$} tails is specific in that it is abrogated by a single point mutation that disrupts integrin localization to talin-rich focal adhesions. Integrin-cytoskeletal interactions regulate integrin affinity for ligands (activation). Overexpression of a fragment of talin containing the head domain led to activation of integrin {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{IIb}{$\beta$}\textsubscript{3}; activation was dependent on the presence of both the talin head domain and the integrin {$\beta$}\textsubscript{3} cytoplasmic tail.

  abstract = {Integrins are transmembrane receptors that support adhesion to the extracellular matrix and transmit chemical and mechanical signals into and out of cells. Cells regulate integrin-mediated adhesion by controlling integrin affinity for extracellular ligands (integrin activation), by clustering integrins into adhesion complexes (avidity modulation) and by regulating links between integrin cytoplasmic domains and the actin cytoskeleton.The large dimeric actin-binding protein talin is a key regulator of integrin activation, and is composed of an amino-terminal head and a carboxy-terminal flexible rod. The structures of all 18 domains in talin have now been determined, and a model of full-length talin has been generated.Biochemical and structural data reveal how direct interactions between the short cytoplasmic tails of {$\beta$}-integrin subunits and the talin head (a FERM domain) disrupt inhibitory interactions between the integrin {$\alpha$}-subunit and {$\beta$}-subunit, inducing conformational changes in the integrin extracellular domains that result in their increased affinity for ligand.The talin rod consists of 13 either 4- or 5-helix bundles, terminating in a single helix that supports talin dimerization. It contains two actin-binding sites and multiple binding sites for the actin-binding protein vinculin, which stabilizes adhesion complexes. Recent data show that the dynamic between talin\textendash RIAM and talin\textendash vinculin interactions is important for integrin activation and force-induced maturation of adhesions.Regulation of talin\textendash integrin interactions represents an important control point along integrin activation pathways. Various regulatory mechanisms have been identified, including talin autoinhibition, competition between talin and other integrin tail-binding or talin-binding proteins and post-translational modification of {$\beta$}-integrin subunits.Although much less well-understood than talins, kindlin family proteins are also known to be important integrin regulators. Kindlin loss, due to knockout, knockdown or disease-causing mutations, result in defective integrin activation.The molecular basis of kindlin function has yet to be determined, but kindlins are structurally related to the talin head, directly bind {$\beta$}-integrin tails and membranes, localize to focal adhesions and synergize with talin during integrin activation.},

  abstract = {Multicellular organisms have well-defined, tightly regulated mechanisms for cell adhesion. Heterodimeric {$\alpha\beta$} integrin receptors play central roles in this function and regulate processes for normal cell functions, including signaling, cell migration, and development, binding to the extracellular matrix, and senescence. They are involved in hemostasis and the immune response, participate in leukocyte function, and have biological implications in angiogenesis and cancer. Proper control of integrin activation for cellular communication with the external environment requires several physiological processes. Perturbation of these equilibria may lead to constitutive integrin activation that results in bleeding disorders. Furthermore, integrins play key roles in cancer progression and metastasis in which certain tumor types exhibit higher levels of various integrins. Thus, the integrin-associated signaling complex is important for cancer therapy development. During inside-out signaling, the cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in regulating integrin affinity whereby the talin head domain activates integrin by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of {$\beta$}-integrin and acidic membrane phospholipids. To understand the mechanism of integrin activation by talin, we determined the crystal structure of the talin head domain bound to the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), allowing us to design a lipid-binding-deficient talin mutant. Our confocal microscopy with talin knockout cells suggests that the talin-cell membrane interaction seems essential for focal adhesion formation and stabilization. Basal integrin activation in Chinese hamster ovary cells suggests that the lipid-binding-deficient talin mutant inhibits integrin activation. Thus, membrane attachment of talin seems necessary for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation.},

The correlation of the tumor-suppressive function and conformation (open or closed) of neurofibromin 2 has been subject to much speculation, often based on extrapolation from other ERM proteins, and controversy. Here we show that lipid binding results in the open conformation of neurofibromin 2 and that lipid binding is necessary for inhibiting cell proliferation. Collectively, our results provide a mechanism in which the open conformation is unambiguously correlated with lipid binding and localization to the membrane, which are critical for the tumor-suppressive function of neurofibromin 2, thus finally reconciling the long-standing conformation and function debate.},

Yet the molecular mechanism that ensures the coordinated movement of many cells remains elusive. Here we show that a tumour suppressor protein, merlin, coordinates collective migration of tens of cells, by acting as a mechanochemical transducer. In a stationary epithelial monolayer and also in three-dimensional human skin, merlin localizes to cortical cell\textendash cell junctions. During migration initiation, a fraction of cortical merlin relocalizes to the cytoplasm. This relocalization is triggered by the intercellular pulling force of the leading cell and depends on the actomyosin-based cell contractility. Then in migrating cells, taking its cue from the intercellular pulling forces, which show long-distance ordering, merlin coordinates polarized Rac1 activation and lamellipodium formation on the multicellular length scale. Together, these results provide a distinct molecular mechanism linking intercellular forces to collective cell movements in migrating epithelia.},

Talin is an integrin-activating and tension-sensing FA component directly connecting integrins in the plasma membrane with the actomyosin cytoskeleton. To understand how talin function is regulated, we determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of full-length talin1 revealing a two-way mode of autoinhibition. The actin-binding rod domains fold into a 15-nm globular arrangement that is interlocked by the integrin-binding FERM head. In turn, the rod domains R9 and R12 shield access of the FERM domain to integrin and the phospholipid PIP\textsubscript{2} at the membrane. This mechanism likely ensures synchronous inhibition of integrin, membrane, and cytoskeleton binding. We also demonstrate that compacted talin1 reversibly unfolds to an {$\sim$}60-nm string-like conformation, revealing interaction sites for vinculin and actin. Our data explain how fast switching between active and inactive conformations of talin could regulate FA turnover, a process critical for cell adhesion and signaling.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The crystal structure of the N-terminal head of the integrin-associated cytoskeletal protein talin reported here reveals a novel FERM domain with a linear domain arrangement, plus an additional domain F0 packed against F1. While F3 binds {$\beta$}-integrin tails, basic residues in F1 and F2 are required for membrane association and for integrin activation. We show that these same residues are also required for cell spreading and focal adhesion assembly in cells. We suggest that the extended conformation of the talin head allows simultaneous binding to integrins via F3 and to PtdIns(4,5)P2-enriched microdomains via basic residues distributed along one surface of the talin head, and that these multiple interactions are required to stabilize integrins in the activated state.},

Diverse cellular responses, such as cell migration, proliferation, and survival, are regulated by FAK. Prior to activation, FAK adopts an autoinhibited conformation in which the FERM domain binds the kinase domain, blocking access to the activation loop and substrate binding site. Activation of FAK occurs through conformational change, and acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) are known to facilitate this process. PIP2 binding alters the autoinhibited conformation of the FERM and kinase domains and subsequently exposes the activation loop to phosphorylation. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of PIP2 binding and its role in FAK activation remain unclear. In this study, we conducted coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding of FAK to PIP2. Our simulations identified novel areas of basic residues in the kinase domain of FAK that potentially undergo transient binding to PIP2 through electrostatic attractions. Our investigation provides a molecular picture of PIP2-initiated FAK activation and introduces promising new pathways for future studies of FAK regulation.},

Although F3 contains the binding site for ?-integrin tails, F0 and F1 are also required for activation of ?1-integrins. Here, we report the solution structures of F0, F1 and of the F0F1 double domain. Both F0 and F1 have ubiquitin-like folds joined in a novel fixed orientation by an extensive charged interface. The F1 insert forms a loop with helical propensity, and basic residues predicted to reside on one surface of the helix are required for binding to acidic phospholipids and for talin-mediated activation of ?1-integrins. This and the fact that basic residues on F2 and F3 are also essential for integrin activation suggest that extensive interactions between the talin FERM domain and acidic membrane phospholipids are required to orientate the FERM domain such that it can activate integrins.},

Mechanical unfolding of proteins may trigger distinct downstream signals in cells, providing a mechanism for cellular mechanotransduction. Force-induced unfolding of talin, a prominent focal adhesion protein, has been demonstrated previously for a small portion of its rod domain. Here, using single-molecule atomic force microscopy (smAFM), we show that the entire talin rod can be unfolded by mechanical extension, over a physiological range of forces between 10 and 40 pN. We also demonstrate, through a combination of smAFM and steered molecular dynamics, that the different bundles within the talin rod exhibit a distinct hierarchy of mechanical stability. These results provide a mechanism by which different force conditions within the cell control a graduated unfolding of the talin rod. Mechanical unfolding of the rod subdomains, and the subsequent effect on talin's binding interactions, would allow for a finely tuned cellular response to internally or externally applied forces.},

The dynamical equations describe the evolution of these two scaling variables and their two conjugate momenta ps and pv. Here we develop a slightly different set of equations, free of time scaling. We find the dynamical steady-state probability density in an extended phase space with variables x, px, V, {$\epsilon\dot$}, and {$\zeta$}, where the x are reduced distances and the two variables {$\epsilon\dot$} and {$\zeta$} act as thermodynamic friction coefficients. We find that these friction coefficients have Gaussian distributions. From the distributions the extent of small-system non-Newtonian behavior can be estimated. We illustrate the dynamical equations by considering their application to the simplest possible case, a one-dimensional classical harmonic oscillator.},

These associations are seen at sites of cell matrix interaction, frequently along stress fibres and sometimes where these bundles of microfilaments terminate at adhesion plaques (focal contacts). Non-morphological evidence also indicates a functional linkage between the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Addition of fibronectin to transformed cells induces flattening of the cells and a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, with the concomitant appearance of arrays of stress fibres4\textendash 6. Conversely, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by treatment with cytochalasin B leads to release of fibronectin from the cell surface7. As yet, there is no detailed knowledge of the molecules involved in this transmembrane linkage, although several proteins have been suggested as candidates in the chain of attachment between bundles of actin filaments and the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane: these include vinculin8, {$\alpha$}-actinin9 and talin10, each one having been identified at regions where bundles of actin filaments interact with the plasma membrane and underlying cell-surface fibronectin10\textendash 13. Recently, the cell-substrate attachment (CSAT) antigen14 has been identified as a plasma membrane receptor for fibronectin15, raising the possibility that this glycoprotein complex may serve as a bridge between fibronectin and one or more of the underlying cytoskeletal components mentioned.

  abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are recognized to play important roles in many biological functions such as transcription and translation regulation, cellular signal transduction, protein phosphorylation, and molecular assemblies. The coupling of folding with binding through a ``fly-casting'' mechanism has been proposed to account for the fast binding kinetics of IDPs. In this article, experimental data from the literature were collated to verify the kinetic advantages of IDPs, while molecular simulations were performed to clarify the origin of the kinetic advantages. The phosphorylated KID\textendash kinase-inducible domain interacting domain (KIX) complex was used as an example in the simulations. By modifying a coarse-grained model with a native-centric G\=o-like potential, we were able to continuously tune the degree of disorder of the phosphorylated KID domain and thus investigate the intrinsic role of chain flexibility in binding kinetics. The simulations show that the ``fly-casting'' effect is not only due to the greater capture radii of IDPs. The coupling of folding with binding of IDPs leads to a significant reduction in binding free-energy barrier. Such a reduction accelerates the binding process. Although the greater capture radius has been regarded as the main factor in promoting the binding rate of IDPs, we found that this parameter will also lead to the slower translational diffusion of IDPs when compared with ordered proteins. As a result, the capture rate of IDPs was found to be slower than that of ordered proteins. The main origin of the faster binding for IDPs are the fewer encounter times required before the formation of the final binding complex. The roles of the interchain native contacts fraction (Qb) and the mass\textendash center distance ({$\Delta$}R) as reaction coordinates are also discussed.},

In this Review, we draw on experiments performed in mammalian cells in culture and Drosophila to present evidence that talin is the most important component of integrin adhesion complexes. We describe how the properties of this adaptor protein enable it to orchestrate integrin adhesions. Talin forms the core of integrin adhesion complexes by linking integrins directly to actin, increasing the affinity of integrin for ligands (integrin activation) and recruiting numerous proteins. It regulates the strength of integrin adhesion, senses matrix rigidity, increases focal adhesion size in response to force and serves as a platform for the building of the adhesion structure. Finally, the mechano-sensitive structure of talin provides a paradigm for how proteins transduce mechanical signals to chemical signals.},

  abstract = {Proper treatment of nonbonded interactions is essential for the accuracy of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, especially in studies of lipid bilayers. The use of the CHARMM36 force field (C36 FF) in different MD simulation programs can result in disagreements with published simulations performed with CHARMM due to differences in the protocols used to treat the long-range and 1-4 nonbonded interactions. In this study, we systematically test the use of the C36 lipid FF in NAMD, GROMACS, AMBER, OpenMM, and CHARMM/OpenMM. A wide range of Lennard-Jones (LJ) cutoff schemes and integrator algorithms were tested to find the optimal simulation protocol to best match bilayer properties of six lipids with varying acyl chain saturation and head groups. MD simulations of a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer were used to obtain the optimal protocol for each program. MD simulations with all programs were found to reasonably match the DPPC bilayer properties (surface area per lipid, chain order parameters, and area compressibility modulus) obtained using the standard protocol used in CHARMM as well as from experiments. The optimal simulation protocol was then applied to the other five lipid simulations and resulted in excellent agreement between results from most simulation programs as well as with experimental data. AMBER compared least favorably with the expected membrane properties, which appears to be due to its use of the hard-truncation in the LJ potential versus a force-based switching function used to smooth the LJ potential as it approaches the cutoff distance. The optimal simulation protocol for each program has been implemented in CHARMM-GUI. This protocol is expected to be applicable to the remainder of the additive C36 FF including the proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecules.},

The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

The C-terminal 197 amino acids of vertebrate talin are 45\% similar to the C-terminal residues of Sla2, a yeast protein implicated in polarized assembly of the yeast actin cytoskeleton. Talin is also homologous in this region to nematode talin, cellular slime mold filopodin, and an Sla2 homolog from nematode. Analysis of the conserved C-terminal sequences of these five proteins with block maker reveals a series of four blocks, which we name the I/LWEQ module after the conserved initial residues in each block. Experiments presented here show that the conserved protein domain represented by the I/LWEQ module competes quantitatively with native talin for binding to F-actin in vitro. Furthermore, the corresponding domain of Sla2 binds to both yeast and vertebrate F-actin in vitro. Mutation of one of the conserved residues in the fourth conserved block abolishes the interaction of the Sla2 I/LWEQ module with F-actin. These results establish the location of an F-actin binding domain in native talin, demonstrate that direct interaction of Sla2 with actin is a possible basis for its effect on the actin cytoskeleton in vivo, and define the I/LWEQ consensus as a new actin-binding motif.},

By quantifying and modelling tissue stress and deformation in the mammalian epidermis, we find that this balance is coordinated through local mechanical forces generated by cell division and delamination. Proliferation within the basal stem/progenitor layer, which displays features of a jammed, solid-like state, leads to crowding, thereby locally distorting cell shape and stress distribution. The resulting decrease in cortical tension and increased cell\textendash cell adhesion trigger differentiation and subsequent delamination, reinstating basal cell layer density. After delamination, cells establish a high-tension state as they increase myosin II activity and convert to E-cadherin-dominated adhesion, thereby reinforcing the boundary between basal and suprabasal layers. Our results uncover how biomechanical signalling integrates single-cell behaviours to couple proliferation, cell fate and positioning to generate a multilayered tissue.},

The performance requirements for visualization and analysis tools delivering these data are increasing rapidly. Significant progress in developing online, web-native three-dimensional (3D) visualization tools was previously accomplished with the introduction of the LiteMol suite and NGL Viewers. Thereafter, Mol* development was jointly initiated by PDBe and RCSB PDB to combine and build on the strengths of LiteMol (developed by PDBe) and NGL (developed by RCSB PDB). The web-native Mol* Viewer enables 3D visualization and streaming of macromolecular coordinate and experimental data, together with capabilities for displaying structure quality, functional, or biological context annotations. High-performance graphics and data management allows users to simultaneously visualise up to hundreds of (superimposed) protein structures, stream molecular dynamics simulation trajectories, render cell-level models, or display huge I/HM structures. It is the primary 3D structure viewer used by PDBe and RCSB PDB. It can be easily integrated into third-party services. Mol* Viewer is open source and freely available at https://molstar.org/.}

The structural and energetic basis of selective PH\textendash PIP interactions is central to understanding many cellular processes, yet the molecular complexities of the PH\textendash PIP interactions are largely unknown. Molecular dynamics simulations using a coarse-grained model enables estimation of free-energy landscapes for the interactions of 12 different PH domains with membranes containing PIP2 or PIP3, allowing us to obtain a detailed molecular energetic understanding of the complexities of the interactions of the PH domains with PIP molecules in membranes. Distinct binding modes, corresponding to different distributions of cationic residues on the PH domain, were observed, involving PIP interactions at either the ``canonical'' (C) and/or ``alternate'' (A) sites. PH domains can be grouped by the relative strength of their C- and A-site interactions, revealing that a higher affinity correlates with increased C-site interactions. These simulations demonstrate that simultaneous binding of multiple PIP molecules by PH domains contributes to high-affinity membrane interactions, informing our understanding of membrane recognition by PH domains in vivo.},

It is unclear how these distinct responses follow from a common event: integrin clustering. We examined the relationship between integrin-mediated signals and the integrin's activation state using a cell line expressing {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{IIb}{$\beta$}\textsubscript{3} (Clone B) and a panel of monoclonal antibodies against this integrin. Nonactivating antibodies used to cluster {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{IIb}{$\beta$}\textsubscript{3} stimulated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation, regardless of affinity, subunit specificity, or ligand-blocking phenotype. Coated on plastic, these antibodies supported cell adhesion, spreading, and FAK phosphorylation. In contrast, clustering of {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{IIb}{$\beta$}\textsubscript{3} induced with activating antibodies, or binding of soluble fibrinogen to antibody-activated {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{IIb}{$\beta$}\textsubscript{3}, did not induce FAK phosphorylation. Thus, clustering of {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{IIb}{$\beta$}\textsubscript{3} on Clone B does not necessarily result in FAK phosphorylation. Coated on plastic, activating antibodies supported cell adhesion, but not spreading or FAK phosphorylation. Therefore, it appears the resting, not the active form of {$\alpha$}\textsubscript{IIb}{$\beta$}\textsubscript{3}, induces cell spreading and FAK phosphorylation in Clone B. These data indicate that "inside-out" signals may alter not only the binding specificity of an integrin, but the "outside-in" biochemical signals that integrin initiates as well. This activation state-linked signaling represents a novel mechanism, which may explain how diverse cellular responses are induced by integrin-matrix interactions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Integrin-dependent adhesion sites consist of clustered integrins that transmit mechanical forces and provide signaling required for cell survival and morphogenesis. Despite their importance, the regulation of integrin clustering by the cytoplasmic adapter protein talin (Tal) and phosphatidylinositol (PI)-4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) lipids nor their dynamic coupling to the actin cytoskeleton is fully understood. By using a Tal-dependent integrin clustering assay in intact cells, we identified a PI(4,5)P2-binding basic ridge spanning across the F2 and F3 domains of the Tal head that regulates integrin clustering. Clustering requires a new PI(4,5)P2-binding site in F2 and is negatively regulated by autoinhibitory interactions between F3 and the Tal rod (Tal-R). The release of the Tal-R exposes a new {$\beta$}3-integrin\textendash binding site in F3, enabling interaction with a membrane proximal acidic motif, which involves the formation of salt bridges between K316 and K324 with E726 and D723, respectively. This interaction shields the {$\beta$}-integrin tail from reassociation with its {$\alpha$} subunit, thereby maintaining the integrin in a substrate-binding and clustering-competent form.},

The formation of cell?matrix adhesions and integrin signalling involves the dynamic recruitment and assembly of an inventory of proteins, collectively termed the ?adhesome?, at the adhesive site. The recruitment of some adhesome proteins, most notably the Lin11-, Isl1- and Mec3-domain-containing proteins, depends on mechanical tension generated by myosin II-mediated contractile forces exerted on cell?matrix adhesions. When exposed to force, mechanosensitive adhesome proteins can change their conformation or expose cryptic-binding sites leading to the recruitment of proteins, rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, reinforcement of the adhesive site and signal transduction. Biophysical methods and proteomics revealed force ranges within the adhesome and cytoskeleton, and also force-dependent changes in adhesome composition. In this review, we provide an overview of the compositional dynamics of cell?matrix adhesions, discuss the most prevalent functional domains in adhesome proteins and review literature and concepts about mechanosensing mechanisms that operate at the adhesion site.},

This paper investigates how binding kinetics is influenced by the folding of a protein. We find that a relatively unstructured protein molecule can have a greater capture radius for a specific binding site than the folded state with its restricted conformational freedom. In this scenario of binding, the unfolded state binds weakly at a relatively large distance followed by folding as the protein approaches the binding site: the "fly-casting mechanism." We illustrate this scenario with the hypothetical kinetics of binding a single repressor molecule to a DNA site and find that the binding rate can be significantly enhanced over the rate of binding of a fully folded protein.},

  abstract = {The activation of heterodimeric ({$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}) integrin transmembrane receptors by cytosolic protein talin is crucial for regulating diverse cell-adhesion-dependent processes, including blood coagulation, tissue remodeling, and cancer metastasis. This process is triggered by the coincident binding of N-terminal FERM (four-point-one-protein/ezrin/radixin/moesin) domain of talin (talin-FERM) to the inner membrane surface and integrin {$\beta$} cytoplasmic tail, but how these binding events are spatiotemporally regulated remains obscure. Here we report the crystal structure of a dormant talin, revealing how a C-terminal talin rod segment (talin-RS) self-masks a key integrin-binding site on talin-FERM via a large interface. Unexpectedly, the structure also reveals a distinct negatively charged surface on talin-RS that electrostatically hinders the talin-FERM binding to the membrane. Such a dual inhibitory topology for talin is consistent with the biochemical and functional data, but differs significantly from a previous model. We show that upon enrichment with phosphotidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) \textendash{} a known talin activator, membrane strongly attracts a positively charged surface on talin-FERM and simultaneously repels the negatively charged surface on talin-RS. Such an electrostatic ``pull-push'' process promotes the relief of the dual inhibition of talin-FERM, which differs from the classic ``steric clash'' model for conventional PIP2-induced FERM domain activation. These data therefore unravel a new type of membrane-dependent FERM domain regulation and illustrate how it mediates the talin on/off switches to regulate integrin transmembrane signaling and cell adhesion.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims: Few circulating tumor cells implant or cause metastasis. We hypothesized that venous or lymphatic pressure or iatrogenic pressure during resection activates signals governing malignant colonocyte adhesion. Methods: We studied the effect of 15 mm Hg increased pressure for 30 minutes on adhesion of primary human colon cancer cells and SW620 colonocytes to collagen and endothelial cells. We modulated integrin affinity with extracellular cations. We assessed binding affinity by detachment assay; integrin surface expression by flow cytometry; and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation by Western analysis and Src in vitro kinase assay. We inhibited Src (PP2), FAK (small RNA interference, SiRNA, or FRNK transfection), MEK (PD98059), PKC (calphostin C), and actin destabilization (phalloidin). Results: Pressure and manganese stimulated primary and SW620 colonocyte adhesion to collagen. Pressure also stimulated SW620 adhesion to endothelial monolayers. Pressure strengthened SW620 binding force to matrix without changing integrin surface expression. Pressure activated SW620 FAK and Src, but not ERK. Manganese did not. Calcium-inhibited adhesion but stimulated FAK (but not Src). PP2 prevented pressure activation of Src, Src phosphorylation of FAK576, and pressure-stimulated adhesion but not FAK397 autophosphorylation. FRNK transfection or FAK SiRNA also prevented pressure-stimulated adhesion. FAK SiRNA ablated pressure-activated FAK397, Src, and FAK576 phosphorylation. Neither Src nor FAK inhibition blocked cation effects. Phalloidin prevented pressure-stimulated adhesion. PD98059 or calphostin C did not. Conclusions: In contrast to divalent cations, extracellular pressure may increase integrin affinity and promote colon cancer adhesion via actin dependent inside-out FAK and Src signals. This mechanotransduced pathway may regulate metastasizing tumor cell adhesion.},

  abstract = {Proper regulation of the formation and stabilization of epithelial cell\textendash cell adhesion is crucial in embryonic morphogenesis and tissue repair processes. Defects in this process lead to organ malformation and defective epithelial barrier function. A combination of chemical and mechanical cues is used by cells to drive this process. We have investigated the role of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and its connection to cell\textendash cell junction complexes in the formation of an epithelial barrier in MDCK cells. We find that the E-cadherin complex is sufficient to mediate a functional link between cell\textendash cell contacts and the actomyosin cytoskeleton. This link involves the actin binding capacity of {$\alpha$}-catenin and the recruitment of the mechanosensitive protein Vinculin to tensile, punctate cell\textendash cell junctions that connect to radial F-actin bundles, which we name Focal Adherens Junctions (FAJ). When cell\textendash cell adhesions mature, these FAJs disappear and linear junctions are formed that do not contain Vinculin. The rapid phase of barrier establishment (as measured by Trans Epithelial Electrical Resistance (TER)) correlates with the presence of FAJs. Moreover, the rate of barrier establishment is delayed when actomyosin contraction is blocked or when Vinculin recruitment to the Cadherin complex is prevented. Enhanced presence of Vinculin increases the rate of barrier formation. We conclude that E-cadherin-based FAJs connect forming cell\textendash cell adhesions to the contractile actomyosin cytoskeleton. These specialized junctions are sites of Cadherin mechanosensing, which, through the recruitment of Vinculin, is a driving force in epithelial barrier formation.},

  abstract = {The shapes of eukaryotic cells and, ultimately, the organisms that they form are defined by cycles of mechanosensing, mechanotransduction and mechanoresponse. Recent studies have shed light into the molecular mechanisms of local mechanosensing and how transduction into biochemical signals could result in whole-cell responses to substrate rigidity.Cellular mechanical phenomena can be described by sequential events: first, mechanosensing that involves a local molecular change in response to changes in force or in geometry (architecture of recognition sites); second, mechanotransduction that involves the conversion of force- or geometry-induced changes into biochemical signals; and third, mechanoresponses, which are changes in cellular function that involve integrated signal responses by motile systems in the short term, and by changes in the molecular composition of the cell in the long term.Force sensing involves the detection of local changes in protein conformation, including protein unfolding. Known mechanisms that are affected by force include opening ion channels, unfolding matrix proteins, cytoplasmic protein unfolding, alterations of enzyme kinetics and catch-bond formation.Geometry sensing involves the detection of the proper spacing of protein sites in clusters, as well as sensing changes in membrane curvature, or in the overall size of protein complexes.Mechanotransduction involves the activation of several signalling pathways, including, but not limited to, the small G proteins, trimeric G proteins, tyrosine phosphorylation, inositol lipid metabolism and calcium level.In tissue engineering, artificial environments have to be designed such that cells will go through different phases with time; however, modifications of the environment by cells pose an important, and complex, problem. The dynamic interplay between cells and their biological matrices over many cycles of mechanosensing, transduction, integrated cell response and matrix remodelling make it difficult to understand how cells know whether to grow, differentiate or undergo apoptosis.},

However, how the structural stability and transition kinetics of the 13 helical bundles of talin are utilized in the diverse talin-dependent mechanosensing processes remains poorly understood. Here we report the force-dependent unfolding and refolding kinetics of all talin rod domains. Using experimentally determined kinetics parameters, we determined the dynamics of force fluctuation during stretching of talin under physiologically relevant pulling speeds and experimentally measured extension fluctuation trajectories. Our results reveal that force-dependent stochastic unfolding and refolding of talin rod domains make talin a very effective force buffer that sets a physiological force range of only a few pNs in the talin-mediated force transmission pathway.},

Here, we present results from molecular dynamics (MD) and mechano-biochemical network simulations that suggest a direct role of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) as a mechano-sensor. Tensile forces, propagating from the membrane through the PIP2 binding site of the FERM domain and from the cytoskeleton-anchored FAT domain, activate FAK by unlocking its central phosphorylation site (Tyr576/577) from the autoinhibitory FERM domain. Varying loading rates, pulling directions, and membrane PIP2 concentrations corroborate the specific opening of the FERM-kinase domain interface, due to its remarkably lower mechanical stability compared to the individual alpha-helical domains and the PIP2-FERM link. Analyzing downstream signaling networks provides further evidence for an intrinsic mechano-signaling role of FAK in broadcasting force signals through Ras to the nucleus. This distinguishes FAK from hitherto identified focal adhesion mechano-responsive molecules, allowing a new interpretation of cell stretching experiments.},
