# Unstructured loop of Talin's FERM domain can serve as a flexible membrane anchor

This allows for interaction with PIP~2~ even in Talin's autoinhibited form
and paves the way to establish known binding surfaces.

## Abstract

![The autoinhibited (Cryo-EM) structure of Talin1 found by @deddenArchitectureTalin1Reveals2019a aligned with the structure of the FERM domain by @elliottStructureTalinHead2010 and the modelled flexible loop in F1 (darker cyan)](assets/blender/render-align/frame0000.png){.wrapping #fig-structure}

Focal adhesions mediate the interaction of the cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix (ECM).
Talin is a central regulator and adaptorprotein of the multiprotein focal adhesion complexes and is responsible for integrin activation and force-sensing.
We evaluated direct interactions of talin with the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP~2~) by means of molecular dynamics simulations.
A newly published autoinhibitory structure of talin, where common PIP~2~ interaction sites are covered up, sparked our curiosity for a hitherto less examined loop as a potential site of first contact.
We show that this unstructured loop in the F1 subdomain of the talin1 FERM domain is able to interact with PIP~2~ and can facilitate further interactions by serving as a flexible membrane anchor.

![A rotational sampling of the F0F1 domain reaveals the strong propensity of the F1 loop to interact with the membrane. Even in the most unfavorable position, the loop still has a high probability to find the membrane and interact with PIP~2~ due to the large search space it can cover.](assets/results/plots/f0f1-ri-angle-npip-1.png){width=80% .center #fig-rot-sample}

**Left**: Once a certain number of residues are interacting, it becomes highly unlikely for F0F1 to dissociate from the membrane. **Right**: Pulling bound F0F1 from the membrane does need some force, but the most important aspect for remaining bound is its flexibility. This allows it to remain in contact with PIP~2~ even at large distances.
